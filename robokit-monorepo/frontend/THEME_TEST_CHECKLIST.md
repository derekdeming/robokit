## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Light Mode Testing**
   - Set theme to "Light" via settings menu
   - Check all text is readable (dark text on light backgrounds)
   - Verify hover states are visible
   - Confirm badges and buttons have proper contrast

2. **Dark Mode Testing**
   - Set theme to "Dark" via settings menu
   - Check all text is readable (light text on dark backgrounds)
   - Verify hover states are visible
   - Confirm badges use appropriate dark mode colors

3. **System Mode Testing**
   - Set theme to "System"
   - Change OS theme preference
   - Verify app follows system preference

### Key Areas to Check:
- [ ] Navigation sidebar (especially bottom user section)
- [ ] Dataset overview badges (total, processing, completed, failed)
- [ ] Dataset cards (View/Delete buttons)
- [ ] Jobs view (both grouped and timeline views)
- [ ] Search inputs and filter dropdowns
- [ ] Error messages and status indicators
- [ ] JSON code viewers in expanded job details

## Color System Reference

### Semantic Colors (Auto-adapt to theme):
- `background` - Main app background
- `foreground` - Main text color
- `card` - Card backgrounds
- `card-foreground` - Card text
- `muted` - Muted backgrounds
- `muted-foreground` - Muted text
- `border` - Border colors
- `primary` - Primary brand color
- `destructive` - Error/delete actions

### With Dark Mode Variants:
When using direct colors, always include dark mode variant:
```css
text-green-600 dark:text-green-400
bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-950/20
border-blue-500 dark:border-blue-400
```

## Summary
All components have been audited and updated to properly support:
- ✅ Light mode
- ✅ Dark mode  
- ✅ System preference mode

The theme system uses Tailwind's dark mode with class strategy, controlled by the ThemeProvider.
